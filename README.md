This is a template repository for [WOM.fm](https://wom.fm). Template repositories let users generate new repositories with the same directory structure and files. It can serve as a sandbox for the development of an audio web application that can be used by local organizations to make vital knowledge and practical information accessible to marginalized, often illiterate populations. You can use the template to create an identical repository on your own GitHub account to play and learn.
