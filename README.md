## NUTRIFEST
 This is a web application that provides educational content on how to resolve malnutrition, healthy eating, 
 hunger, and good health in audio format for marginalized communities.
 
 It is an OpenSource project that provides educational resources on practical ways to achieve SDG goal two---To end 
 hunger, achieve food security and improve nutrition. Read more about SDG goals [here](https://sdgs.un.org/)

 In a bid to ensure the agenda of  this application is met, it provides content in both English Language and Yoruba Language which are the most common modes of communication in these communities.
